## Intro
"Flip the switch on MFA and you think you're done? Not quite."

Turning on a single security setting won't keep your cloud safe. True protection starts with figuring out why you are in the cloud, who owns the risk and how it will help your business.

Today I will walk you through the first step of Microsoft's Cloud Adaption Framework 'Strategy' and share a ten-question worksheet to get you and your team on the same page before you touch a VM.

## What is the Cloud Adaption Framework?
The Cloud Adaption Framework is Microsoft's guide to doing Azure right. It breaks the journey into six steps:

**1. Strategy**: Figure out what you want to archieve and who needs to be involved
**2. Plan**: Turn those goals into a list of projects and quick wins
**3. Ready**: Build your secure foundation in the cloud
**4. Adopt**: Move and create workloads under those guardrails
**5. Govern**: Keep policies in place and measure compliance
**6. Manage**: Run and improve your enviroment over time

In this post we will focus on Strategy. 
We will define your goals, your appetite for risk and the measures of the success that guide every step that follows.

## Define your strategy
Walk through the heart of strategy in three parts:

**1. Business Goals and Metrics**
Ask your team to name the top three things they expect Azure to deliver.
Then turn each into a simple, measurable goal.

<table>
  <thread>
    <tr>
      <th>Objective</th>
      <th>Matric</th>
      <th>Deadline</th>
    </tr>
  </thread>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Cut IT operating costs</td>
      <td>Reduce monthly spend by 20%</td>
      <td>Dec 31, 2025</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Launch new features</td>
      <td>New release every four weeks</td>
      <td>Jun 30, 2025</td> 
    </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>Pass an ISO 27001 audit</td>
      <td>Zero critical findings</td>
      <td>Mar 1, 2026</td> 
    </tr>  
  </tbody>
