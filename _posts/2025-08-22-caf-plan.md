## Intro

Most Cloud Adoption Framework guides start by building platforms. This one starts with **people and a plan**. 

If you’re an MSP or system integrator with on-prem customers or your own data center, use this **hybrid-first path** to turn strategy into action fast:<br>
- Confirm outcomes
- Assign roles using **RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)**
- Snapshot the **digital estate**
- Choose the **“8 Rs”** per workload (**Retire, Retain, Rehost, Replatform, Refactor, Rearchitect, Rebuild, Replace**)
- And **sequence the first migration wave** before touching landing zones

Along the way you’ll get ready-to-use assets:<br>
- A printable Workshop Playmat
- An **Extended Security Updates and Support cheat sheet**
- A **VMware exit decision tree**
- And a **PowerShell inventory script**

The result is a **living adoption backlog** that respects real-world constraints—and actually ships value.
