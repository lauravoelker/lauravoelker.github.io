## Intro

Most Cloud Adoption Framework guides start by building platforms. This one starts with **people and a plan**. 

If you’re an MSP or system integrator with on-prem customers or your own data center, use this **hybrid-first path** to turn strategy into action fast:<br>
▸ Confirm outcomes<br>
▸ Assign roles using **RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)**<br>
▸ Snapshot the **digital estate**<br>
▸ Choose the **“8 Rs”** per workload (**Retire, Retain, Rehost, Replatform, Refactor, Rearchitect, Rebuild, Replace**)<br>
▸ And **sequence the first migration wave** before touching landing zones<br>

Along the way you’ll get ready-to-use assets:<br>
▸ A printable Workshop Playmat<br>
▸ An **Extended Security Updates and Support cheat sheet**<br>
▸ A **VMware exit decision tree**<br>
▸ And a **PowerShell inventory script**

The result is a **living adoption backlog** that respects real-world constraints and actually ships value.

## People First → Roles & RACI

Before you touch platforms, make ownership crystal-clear. Define who drives adoption, who runs platform guardrails, and who is accountable per workload.

### RACI (starter table, edit to fit)
| Workstream / Workload         | Purpose (what this team owns)                 | Responsible (R)     | Accountable (A)     | Consulted (C)                          | Informed (I)               |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Adoption (overall)            | Backlog, wave planning, comms & change        | Cloud Adoption Lead | Exec Sponsor        | CIO, CISO, PMO                         | Helpdesk, Finance          |
| Platform guardrails           | Identity, networking, policy, landing zones   | Platform/Infra Lead | Head of IT          | Security, Networking, Identity         | App Owners                 |
| Security & compliance         | Reviews, risk mgmt, compliance mapping        | Security Lead       | CISO                | Platform, Data, Legal                  | Exec Sponsor, PMO          |
| **Workload: Customer Portal** | Wave-1 delivery for this app                  | App Team Lead       | LoB/Product Owner   | Platform, Security, DBAs               | Support, PMO               |
| **Workload: Data Warehouse**  | Wave-1 delivery for this data platform        | Data/Analytics Lead | LoB/Product Owner   | Platform, Security, Networking         | Support, PMO               |

▸ Tip: Replace role titles with **names** once confirmed. Keep the table in your repo/wiki and update **per wave**.

### Quick checklist (tick before touching platforms)<br>
▸ [ ] **Accountability set:** Each Wave-1 workload has a named **A** (Accountable) and an **R** (Responsible)<br>
▸ [ ] **Capacity secured:** Adoption & Platform teams have bandwidth and **time-boxed** commitments<br>
▸ [ ] **Security in the loop:** Security/Compliance are **C** (Consulted) with a defined review **SLA** (e.g., 3 business days)<br>
▸ [ ] **Cadence agreed:** Reporting rhythm set (weekly/bi-weekly) with a short, consistent template<br>
▸ [ ] **Escalation path:** Who unblocks decisions within **24–48h** is documented<br>
▸ [ ] **Kick-off booked (60 min):** Outcomes/KPIs (10) → Wave-1 candidates (15) → Draft RACI (15) → Next steps (20)<br>
▸ [ ] **Published & visible:** RACI stored in a shared location; owners linked on backlog items<br>
▸ [ ] **Next 7–10 days committed:** 3–5 tasks assigned with owners & due dates (e.g., estate snapshot, 8Rs workshop, security review)<br>
