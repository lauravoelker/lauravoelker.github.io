## Intro

Most Cloud Adoption Framework guides start by building platforms. This one starts with **people and a plan**. 

If you’re an MSP or system integrator with on-prem customers or your own data center, use this **hybrid-first path** to turn strategy into action fast:<br>
▸ Confirm outcomes<br>
▸ Assign roles using **RACI**<br>
(Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)<br>
▸ Snapshot the **digital estate**<br>
▸ Choose the **“8 Rs”** per workload<br>
(**Retire, Retain, Rehost, Replatform, Refactor, Rearchitect, Rebuild, Replace**)<br>
▸ And **sequence the first migration wave** before touching landing zones<br>

Along the way you’ll get ready-to-use assets:<br>
▸ A printable Workshop Playmat<br>
▸ An **Extended Security Updates and Support cheat sheet**<br>
▸ A **VMware exit decision tree**<br>
▸ And a **PowerShell inventory script**

The result is a **living adoption backlog** that respects real-world constraints and actually ships value.

## People First → Roles & RACI

Before you touch platforms, make ownership crystal-clear. Define who drives adoption, who runs platform guardrails, and who is accountable per workload.

**RACI**
<table class="table table--raci">
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Workstream / Workload</th>
      <th scope="col">Purpose (what this team owns)</th>
      <th scope="col">Responsible (R)</th>
      <th scope="col">Accountable (A)</th>
      <th scope="col">Consulted (C)</th>
      <th scope="col">Informed (I)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Adoption (overall)</th>
      <td>Backlog, wave planning, comms &amp; change</td>
      <td>Cloud Adoption Lead</td>
      <td>Exec Sponsor</td>
      <td>CIO, CISO, PMO</td>
      <td>Helpdesk, Finance</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Platform guardrails</th>
      <td>Identity, networking, policy, landing zones</td>
      <td>Platform/Infra Lead</td>
      <td>Head of IT</td>
      <td>Security, Networking, Identity</td>
      <td>App Owners</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Security &amp; compliance</th>
      <td>Reviews, risk mgmt, compliance mapping</td>
      <td>Security Lead</td>
      <td>CISO</td>
      <td>Platform, Data, Legal</td>
      <td>Exec Sponsor, PMO</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><strong>Workload: Customer Portal</strong></th>
      <td>Wave 1 delivery for this app</td>
      <td>App Team Lead</td>
      <td>LoB/Product Owner</td>
      <td>Platform, Security, DBAs</td>
      <td>Support, PMO</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><strong>Workload: Data Warehouse</strong></th>
      <td>Wave 1 delivery for this data platform</td>
      <td>Data/Analytics Lead</td>
      <td>LoB/Product Owner</td>
      <td>Platform, Security, Networking</td>
      <td>Support, PMO</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><em>Tip:</em> Replace role titles with <strong>names</strong> once confirmed. Keep the table in your repo/wiki and update <strong>per wave</strong>.</p>


## Quick checklist (tick before touching platforms)<br>
▸ [ ] **Accountability set:** <br>
Each Wave-1 workload has a named **A** (Accountable) and an **R** (Responsible)<br>
▸ [ ] **Capacity secured:** <br>
Adoption & Platform teams have bandwidth and **time-boxed** commitments<br>
▸ [ ] **Security in the loop:** <br>
Security/Compliance are **C** (Consulted) with a defined review **SLA** (e.g., 3 business days)<br>
▸ [ ] **Cadence agreed:** <br>
Reporting rhythm set (weekly/bi-weekly) with a short, consistent template<br>
▸ [ ] **Escalation path:** <br>
Who unblocks decisions within **24–48h** is documented<br>
▸ [ ] **Kick-off booked (60 min):** <br>
Outcomes/KPIs (10) → Wave-1 candidates (15) → Draft RACI (15) → Next steps (20)<br>
▸ [ ] **Published & visible:** <br>
RACI stored in a shared location; owners linked on backlog items<br>
▸ [ ] **Next 7–10 days committed:** <br>
3–5 tasks assigned with owners & due dates (e.g., estate snapshot, 8Rs workshop, security review)<br>
